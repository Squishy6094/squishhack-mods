# SquishyHack Mods
A reimagining of the previously existing "Rom-Hack Mods" mod for SM64CoopDX, aiming to focus on making SM64 feel fresh and different!

Rather than just being a taped together pack of Quality of Life mods, SquishHack aims to change the game properties enough to feel new while keeping everything congruent with itself. The goal is a completly stylied Add-on that's not in the way too much, and becomes a must-have for replaying any campeign 

Listed of planned things so I don't forget:
- Completly reworked HUD made from the ground up
- Smooth star select / level intros focusing around the stage before focusing in on the spawn point
- Unique health system inspired by Modern Mario games, makng health both more consistent and challenging to deal with
- 1-ups giving bonus health rather than lives
- Reworked pause menu to make 100%ing a little lighter weight
- Level info on approaching painting, inspired by emilyemmi's mod
- Super Mario Wonder styled standees/checkpoints for harder levels
- Compatibility with any Rom-Hack
- (Possibly going to shove the old profiles mod idea in here)
